            Challenges:
          </h3>
          <p>
            Often, products and environments are designed without considering
            the full spectrum of human diversity, particularly people with
            disabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            A11y Designs provides a platform where inclusivity is central to the
            design process, enabling designers to create products that are
            usable and beneficial for people with a wide range of abilities.
          </p>
          <ol className="mt-6">
            Other Challenges this app addresses are:
            <li>
              the knowledge gap in understanding how to implement accessibility
              standards and inclusive design principles
            </li>
            <li>
              the difficulty for designers without disabilities to fully
              understand the challenges faced by users with disabilities.
            </li>
          </ol>

            User Research
          </h3>
          <p className="text-justify px-4">
            Specializing in the intersection of design and accessibility, my
            user research delves deep into understanding the unique needs,
            preferences, and challenges faced by diverse user groups. With a
            holistic background spanning from architecture to UX design, my
            approach emphasizes creating inclusive environments—both digital and
            physical. Through meticulous analysis, empathy-driven testing, and a
            commitment to human-centered design, I aim to champion products and
            spaces that resonate universally, ensuring every individual feels
            seen, heard, and catered to.
